# Welcome to the Mbaza NLP Community!

We are a community working on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Kinyarwanda and other low-resource languages. For example, we are working on Kinyarwanda automatic speech recognition (ASR, also known as Speech-to-Text, STT), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and semantic chatbots.

The code, models and datasets will be shared soon on [Github](https://github.com/MBAZA-NLP) and/or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/mbazaNLP).

| Vision | Mission |
| ------ | ------- |
| Sustainable community rooted in partnership, extending on pre-existing open packages to create inclusive NLP solutions for Kinyarwanda and other low-resource languages | Foster the use of NLP and AI, to implement innovative use cases in Rwanda and the East Africa region |

## Background information
The community builds on the technology developed for the [Mbaza COVID-19 Chatbot](https://digicenter.rw/achieving-information-access-equity-using-ai-in-the-fight-against-corona/) by a consortium of partners including GIZ, Digital Umuganda, Arxia, Mozilla and RISA. This technology is now made freely available to the community to continue the development on the technology and to use it for exciting new use cases.
